# Final-Project---Introduction-to-Tableau-Desktop-For-Data-Fundamentals-Course.-
This project is part of the "Project-Based Learning Program in Data Analysis" course, offered by IBM SkillsBuild in collaboration with Academy STC. 

The project aims to apply skills learned using Tableau Desktop, a tool for analyzing and visualizing data. During the course, I learned how to collect, analyze, and visualize data, and in this final project, I created interactive reports and charts using Tableau to enhance decision-making through graphical analysis.

Learning Plan Overview:

> Data Fundamentals 5 modules:
1- Introduction to Data Concepts.
2- Data Science in Our World.
3- Overview of Data Tools and Languages.
4- Clean, Refine, and Visualize Data with IBM Watson Studio.
5- Your Future in Data: The Job Landscape.

> Final Project – Introduction to Tableau Desktop.

> Presentations: Online, Live Sessions.

The steps below to complete this activity.
1- Connect to the Microsoft Excel file, Global Library Data.xlsx.

2- On the Data Source page, add the Country Data sheet to the canvas.

3- Open a new worksheet to get ready to analyze your data, which you will do in the next hands-on activity in this module.

4- Save the file name Global Library Data.twb

now you want to analyze that data to answer these questions: 

Which region has the fewest libraries? Which has the next fewest?
Which country has the highest expenditures? Which country has the highest total users?
To find those answers, build two different views for analysis in Tableau Desktop: a bar chart and crosstab. Use the bar chart to compare the number of total libraries in the different regions. Then use the crosstab to see specific values for each country.

The file below to use with this activity.

Analyze data in two views_starter.twbx
1- Create a horizontal bar chart comparing Total Libraries by Region.

2- Sort the view by Total Libraries, in descending order, so you can compare the regions. Which region has the fewest libraries? Which has the next fewest? 
Oceania has the fewest and then the Middle East.

Q: which region has 43,572 libraries, and where does it fall in the order, from highest to lowest?
Africa, fifth.

Create and analyze your data in a crosstab

Next, you want to find the country with the highest library expenditures and the one with the highest total library users. To compare specific values for each country, you'll build a crosstab. 

1- Start a new worksheet for your crosstab.
2- To start the crosstab, create row headers for each Country.
3- Add data to the crosstab for the following measures: Expenditures, Total Libraries, Total Users, and Total Volumes.

4- Sort the columns to find the country with the most library Expenditures and the one with the most Total Users. Remember that each sort re-sorts the rest of the table.

Q:Examining the crosstab, which country has the greatest number of Total Volumes?
Germany

5- Name the worksheet “Country Details” and save the file

---------------------------
The steps below to complete this activity.
1- Open the starter file.
2- Create a dashboard with the Total Libraries by Region bar chart on top and the Country Details crosstab on the bottom.
3- Adjust the Country Details crosstab to fit the width and make the size taller.

4- Set the Total Libraries by Region bar chart to be used as a filter for the Country Details crosstab.

5- Use the bar chart filter and use sorting to determine which country in Asia has the highest library Expenditures.

6- Q:Which Latin American country has the greatest number of Total Libraries?
Brazil

7- Title the dashboard and include instructions on how to filter.

8- Save the file as a packaged workbook (.twbx).
