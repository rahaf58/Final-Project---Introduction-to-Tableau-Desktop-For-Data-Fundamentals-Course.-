# Final-Project---Introduction-to-Tableau-Desktop-For-Data-Fundamentals-Course.-
This project is part of the "Project-Based Learning Program in Data Analysis" course, offered by IBM SkillsBuild in collaboration with Academy STC. 

The project aims to apply skills learned using Tableau Desktop, a tool for analyzing and visualizing data. During the course, I learned how to collect, analyze, and visualize data, and in this final project, I created interactive reports and charts using Tableau to enhance decision-making through graphical analysis.

Learning Plan Overview:

> Data Fundamentals 5 modules:
1- Introduction to Data Concepts.
2- Data Science in Our World.
3- Overview of Data Tools and Languages.
4- Clean, Refine, and Visualize Data with IBM Watson Studio.
5- Your Future in Data: The Job Landscape.

> Final Project – Introduction to Tableau Desktop.

> Presentations: Online, Live Sessions.

Next steps to complete the project:
1- Connect to the Microsoft Excel file, Global Library Data.xlsx.

2- On the Data Source page, I added the Country Data sheet to the canvas.

3- I opened a new worksheet to prepare for data analysis.

4- I saved the file as Global Library Data.twb.

The data was analyzed to answer these questions:

Which region has the fewest libraries? Which has the next fewest?
Which country has the highest expenditures? Which country has the highest total users?


1- I created a horizontal bar chart comparing Total Libraries by Region.

2- I sorted the display by Total Libraries, in descending order, so I could  compare the regions. Which region has the fewest libraries? Which has the next fewest? 
Oceania has the fewest and then the Middle East.

Q: which region has 43,572 libraries, and where does it fall in the order, from highest to lowest?
Africa, fifth.

Creating and Analyzing Data in a Crosstab

Next, I wanted  to find the country with the highest library expenditures and the one with the highest total library users. To compare specific values for each country, I created a crosstab.

1- First, I created a new worksheet for my crosstab.
2- To start the crosstab, I created row headers for each Country.
3- I added data to the crosstab for the following measures: Expenditures, Total Libraries, Total Users, and Total Volumes.

4- I sorted the columns to find the country with the most library Expenditures and the one with the most Total Users.

Q:Examining the crosstab, which country has the greatest number of Total Volumes?
Germany

5- Name the worksheet “Country Details”.

6- I created  a dashboard with the Total Libraries by Region bar chart on top and the Country Details crosstab on the bottom.
7- I modified the Country Details crosstab to fit the width and make the size taller.

8- I set the Total Libraries by Region bar chart to use as a filter for the Country Details crosstab.

9- I used the bar chart filter and sorted to determine which country in Asia has the highest library Expenditures.

10- Q:Which Latin American country has the greatest number of Total Libraries?
Brazil

11- I named the dashboard and include instructions on how to filter.
